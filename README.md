# How to make a first assessment on events for sponsoring, participation, contribution, speaking

This process was an implementation of a less-biased (TM) decision matrix, that I designed in my first weeks as a Porgram Manager in DevRel at Postman. It is not without flaws, and can never be the single reason for making a decision on an event. But it can give you a first glance on your priorities, especially if you have to handle more than 10 events per calendar year.

## The Process
A) Data Collection
1) Source as many events as you like from a Survey Tool (in our case Typeform) into Airtable. The data collected through that is currently:
 - Event Name
 - Calendar Year
 - Homepage
 - Event Type
 - Topic
 - Location, Country, Continent
 - Start & End Date
 - # of Attendees
 - Attendance Fee in USD
 - Sponsoring Packages
 - Call for Porposals details
 - Code of Conduct details
 - Previous participation of colleagues
 - Competitive participation
 - # Speakers and representation of marginalized groups
 - Colleagues as speakers
 - Qualitative feedback
 - Opportunity for focus topics
 - Online availability of sessions post-event

2) Set up your Airtable Base. You can copy and start from this one, as it already has the structure set up.
3) Connect Typeform to Airtable. Alternatively fill the Airtable manually or import existing data.
4) Clean and complete data in Airtable.
5) Import of [fork](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/version-control-for-collections/) [this Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/lichtsucht/workspace/demo-space/collection/11948645-a6307c6d-39dc-457a-bf19-455158425ff5?ctx=documentation).
4) Get your [Airtable API key from here](https://airtable.com/account).
5) Run the collection in Postman's Runner.
